    "description": "Cypress queues every command into a single chain of commands to be executed. This sometimes confuses people new to Cypress; what commands are in the queue? What are their arguments? Why does cy.log print an undefined value? In this video, I introduce the https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-command-chain - a tiny module that adds to the Cypress Command Log the \"Command Queue\" list. It shows all queued up commands with their arguments, making it clear which test commands have finished, and which ones are still about to run. \n\nTake a look at my presentation https://slides.com/bahmutov/reactive-conf for more information about Cypress command queue and how it is different from the other test runners.",

The right way is to first assert the value (if necessary) and then call the \"checkFruit\" function just once using cy.then instead of cy.should\n\ncy.wait('@fruit')\n  .its('response.body.fruit')\n  .should('be.a', 'string')\n  .then(checkFruit)\n\nFor more, read the blog post \"Cypress Should Callback\" https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/cypress-should-callback/",

    "description": "This video shows how I wait for the page to fully load by observing the new elements that appear during the tests, and the Ajax calls the application is making. My goal is to only work with the page after it has finished loading and re-rendering (otherwise I might get a dreaded \"Element detached from DOM\" Cypress error). In this case, when testing a Shopware site, the charts were loaded at the start, and the menu items were getting their labels from the server using an Ajax call. If the test does not \"wait\" for the labels, it might try to click the menu item. If the Ajax call returns and the application re-renders the menu item element, Cypress might fail to click the menu properly. Here is my more robust test:\n\n// make sure the application has finished loading its charts\ncy.get('.sw-chart').should('have.length.gte', 2)\ncy.get('.sw-admin-menu__item--sw-order').click()\n// the menu item will request the label \"Overview\" from the server\n// let's wait for that menu to appear before clicking the menu item\ncy.contains('.navigation-list-item__sw-order-index', 'Overview').click()\n// verify we end up on the right page after the menu click\ncy.location('hash').should('include', '/sw/order/index')\n\nFor more information, see video https://youtu.be/CMOjrKoBBwc",

For example, the following test code inside a Cypress test will fail with an error:\n\n.then(function () {\n  cy.wrap('Anna')\n   return 'Joe'\n})\n\nCypress is not sure which value do you want to yield from the .then callback: \"Anna\" or \"Joe\". The same error happens even if you use something like cy.log\n\nthen(function () {\n  cy.log('returning Joe')\n   return 'Joe'\n})\n\nThe solution is to never use both Cy commands and a return statement inside the same .then callback. For example, if you want to log a value, attach its own callback \n\nthen(function () {\n  cy.log('returning Joe').then(function () {\n     return 'Joe'\n  })\n})\n\nAlternative solution: print in a separate .then\n\n.then(function () {\n  cy.log('returning Joe')\n})\n.then(function () {\n   return 'Joe'\n})\n\nAlternative solution: Cypress yields the value from its last command. Instead of \"return\" use cy.wrap command\n\nthen(function () {\n  cy.log('returning Joe')\n   cy.wrap('Joe')\n})\nSee the solutions in my https://glebbahmutov.com/cypress-examples/ under \"Yield value\" recipe",

Find more documentation at https://on.cypress.io/window and at https://glebbahmutov.com/cypress-examples/commands/window.html\n\nTip: exposing the application methods via \"window\" object to the Cypress tests is very convenient and can super-charge your tests, take a look at https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/01/03/stop-using-page-objects-and-start-using-app-actions/ blog post.",

By removing the attribute, the application signals to the user and to the test runner, that it is ready to accept the user actions.
